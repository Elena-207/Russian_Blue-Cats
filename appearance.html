                      Russian Blue cats are considered a medium-size cat breed. They have a signature upturn in the corners of their mouth, giving them a permanent Mona Lisa-like smile. They’re also known for their graceful, firm demeanor, muscular bodies and long, fine-boned legs</p>

                  <h3>Russian Blue Coats</h3>
                  <p>
                      The Russian Blue’s short, dense, double-layered coat is a clear indication that this breed originated in a cold climate — after all, Archangel is only 150 miles from the Arctic Circle. Their dense coats can also make a Russian Blue appear larger than they really are. Although they have thick coats, they don’t shed too often but should still be brushed at least once a week.
                      <p>Russian Blue cats have solid, velvety coat colors that can be varying shades of bluish gray, silver or slate. Petfinder explains that blue is the diluted version of black in the pet world, and the gene responsible for the breed’s blue-gray coloring is a form of the black hair gene.</p>

                      <p>Russian blues are medium-sized cats with plush, dense short coats of hair that stand out from their bodies and make them appear larger than they truly are. Their soft, silky coats are a dark, charcoal gray shade tipped with light, shimmering silver. 
                      Because these cats shed lightly and have lower levels of known feline allergens, some pet owners consider them "hypoallergenic." </p>
                      <p>"These cats produce very low levels of glycoprotein Fel d 1, which is the protein in cats that creates allergies in people," says Natalie L. Marks, DVM, CVJ, veterinarian at Blum Animal Hospital in Chicago.</p>
                      <p>So while there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic cat, some breeds, including the Russian blue, might be a better fit for some people with allergies. Before bringing home a Russian blue kitten, spend time with the breed to see how your allergies react.</p>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Eye Color</h3>
                  <p>
                      Round, wide-set eyes in striking shades of green perfectly complement the Russian Blue’s beautiful coat.
                      One of the most interesting aspects of a Russian blue's appearance is her eyes, which change in hue from yellow to green over time. Like all kittens, Russian blue kittens are born with blue eyes. The blue fades to a light yellow or golden, then turns to yellow with a green ring around four months old and, finally, turns fully bright green in adulthood.
