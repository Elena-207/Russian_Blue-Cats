                  <h2>The history of Russian Blue cats</h2>

                  <p> Russian Blue cats are an older, naturally occurring breed, meaning they were not manmade like Toyger cats. Because of their long history, the breed’s exact origins are unknown.</p>
                  <p> The Spruce says that the Russian Blues are believed to have originated on Archangel (Arkhangelsk) Island in northern Russia, which is why they were once referred to as Archangel cats.</p>
                  <p>Just as the ancient Egyptians worshipped tuxedo cats, Russian Blues were favored by royals and Russian czars.</p>  
                  <p>The breed travelled to Great Britain and many parts of Europe by ship in the late 1800s, and they were even among the contestants in the first cat shows in England.</p>

                   <p>Once they were in Europe, the development of the breed really took off, primarily in Great Britain and Scandinavia where showing and breeding cats was popular. Russian Blues made their first appearance in the U.S. in the early 1900s, but they didn’t become popular until after World War II.
                  </p>
                  <p>Once Russian Blue cats made it to Great Britain, the breed took the cat world by storm. In 1875, Russian Blues were shown at one of the world’s first cat shows held at London’s Crystal Palace.</p>
                  <p>They didn’t win any prizes but left quite an impression – mainly that they were incredibly handsome.</p>
                  <p>In 1912, around the same time Russian Blues were making their way to the U.S., they were officially recognized as a breed.</p>
                  <p>After World War II, Russian Blues were in decline, but enthusiasts managed to save the bloodline. In Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, they crossbred Russian Blues with Siamese cats to produce slightly longer and more angular kitties.</p>
                  <p>In Great Britain, they crossbred with Bluepoint Siamese and British Blues for thicker, stockier cats. However, the Russian Blues we know and love today more closely resemble the original breed.</p>
