                  <p>Grooming needs for the Russian blue are pretty low-maintenance.</p>

                  <p>These cats require few baths and only weekly brushing to help rid them of loose hairs and keep shedding to a minimum. Regular nail trimming, eye, and ear cleaning are necessary as well.</p>
                  <p>These pets don't need any special exercise regimen—like most cats, they'll work out a lot of energy themselves by playing and running around the house. You can help by leaving out some toys for your Russian blue to play with. </p>
                  <p>The Russian blue is a smart breed, and they're receptive to training. Teaching your cat to use a litter box and scratching post should be fairly easy, although lots of praise and petting are always helpful training tools.</p>
                  <p> Feed your Russian blue high-quality cat food and monitor food intake to help prevent obesity, which the breed is especially prone to. Check in with your vet to know how much and how often to feed your cat.</p>
                  <p>Russian blues have a long lifespan of 15–20 years. These cats are generally healthy animals, thanks in large part to the fact that they are a naturally occurring breed.</p>

                  <p>"This breed loves to eat and may struggle with obesity," Marks says. "They can develop progressive retinal atrophy (or PRA), which is a degenerative deterioration of the retina or vision center of the eye. Additionally, they can develop polycystic kidney disease (or PKD), in which the kidneys become full of fluid-filled spaces, obstructing them from working."</p>
                  <p>Reputable Russian blue breeders will screen for health issues in kittens, but it's important to have your cat screened often into adulthood. Prioritize regular veterinarian visits for your Russian blue and take the advice of your cat's vet.</p>
